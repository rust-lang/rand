//! # Monte Carlo estimation of π with a chosen seed and rayon for parallelism
//!
//! Imagine that we have a square with sides of length 2 and a unit circle
//! (radius = 1), both centered at the origin. The areas are:
//!
//! ```text
//!     area of circle  = πr² = π * r * r = π
//!     area of square  = 2² = 4
//! ```
//!
//! The circle is entirely within the square, so if we sample many points
//! randomly from the square, roughly π / 4 of them should be inside the circle.
//!
//! We can use the above fact to estimate the value of π: pick many points in
//! the square at random, calculate the fraction that fall within the circle,
//! and multiply this fraction by 4.
//!
//! Note on determinism:
//! It's slightly tricky to build a parallel simulation using Rayon
//! which is both efficient *and* reproducible.
//!
//! Rayon's ParallelIterator api does not guarantee that the work will be
//! batched into identical batches on every run, so we can't simply use
//! map_init to construct one RNG per Rayon batch.
//!
//! Instead, we do our own batching, so that a Rayon work item becomes a
//! batch. Then we can fix our rng stream to the batched work item.
//! Batching amortizes the cost of constructing the Rng from a fixed seed
//! over BATCH_SIZE trials. Manually batching also turns out to be faster
//! for the nondeterministic version of this program as well.
