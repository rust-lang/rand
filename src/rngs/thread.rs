// Rationale for using `UnsafeCell` in `ThreadRng`:
//
// Previously we used a `RefCell`, with an overhead of ~15%. There will only
// ever be one mutable reference to the interior of the `UnsafeCell`, because
// we only have such a reference inside `next_u32`, `next_u64`, etc. Within a
// single thread (which is the definition of `ThreadRng`), there will only ever
// be one of these methods active at a time.
//
// A possible scenario where there could be multiple mutable references is if
// `ThreadRng` is used inside `next_u32` and co. But the implementation is
// completely under our control. We just have to ensure none of them use
// `ThreadRng` internally, which is nonsensical anyway. We should also never run
// `ThreadRng` in destructors of its implementation, which is also nonsensical.

// Number of generated bytes after which to reseed `ThreadRng`.
// According to benchmarks, reseeding has a noticeable impact with thresholds
// of 32 kB and less. We choose 64 kB to avoid significant overhead.

/// A reference to the thread-local generator
///
/// This type is a reference to a lazily-initialized thread-local generator.
/// An instance can be obtained via [`rand::rng()`][crate::rng())] or via
/// `ThreadRng::default()`.
/// The handle cannot be passed between threads (is not `Send` or `Sync`).
///
/// `ThreadRng` uses the same CSPRNG as [`StdRng`], ChaCha12. As with
/// [`StdRng`], the algorithm may be changed, subject to reasonable expectations
/// of security and performance.
///
/// `ThreadRng` is automatically seeded from [`OsRng`] with periodic reseeding
/// (every 64 kiB â€” see [`ReseedingRng`] documentation for details).
///
/// `ThreadRng` is not automatically reseeded on fork. It is recommended to
/// explicitly call [`ThreadRng::reseed`] immediately after a fork, for example:
/// ```ignore
/// fn do_fork() {
///     let pid = unsafe { libc::fork() };
///     if pid == 0 {
///         // Reseed ThreadRng in child processes:
///         rand::rng().reseed();
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Methods on `ThreadRng` are not reentrant-safe and thus should not be called
/// from an interrupt (e.g. a fork handler) unless it can be guaranteed that no
/// other method on the same `ThreadRng` is currently executing.
///
/// Security must be considered relative to a threat model and validation
/// requirements. `ThreadRng` attempts to meet basic security considerations
/// for producing unpredictable random numbers: use a CSPRNG, use a
/// recommended platform-specific seed ([`OsRng`]), and avoid
/// leaking internal secrets e.g. via [`Debug`] implementation or serialization.
/// Memory is not zeroized on drop.
///
/// [`ReseedingRng`]: crate::rngs::ReseedingRng
/// [`StdRng`]: crate::rngs::StdRng
